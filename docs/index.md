# RoenBlog
Welcome to my personal space!

I'm Jeroen and this where I share my ideas. I love engineering, sillyness, rock climbing, philosophy as well as people and this world in general.

At the moment this site is a bit rough because I just got started. I love juggling information and finding  connections. That's why I work with an [external mind](external_mind/index.md). Now that I have this space to publish and share ideas, I'll work on getting articles and thoughts I wrote down in better shape.
